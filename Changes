    [0.25]
        - Fix incorrect ExtUtils::CBuilder detection routine leading to
          Makefile.PL crashes when EU::CB is not available

    [0.24]
        - Properly skip debugger test when optional deps not available
        - Make sure pure-perl tests pass correctly on space-containing
          paths (RT#77528)
        - Remove all the pure-perl fallback code and depend on PP-capable
          B::H::EOS 0.12

    [0.23]
        - Rely on B::Hooks::EndOfScope version 0.10 to fix issues with
          new Module::Runtime versions (>= 0.012) on perl 5.10 due
          to incorrect hook firing due to %^H localisation.
        - Fix failures on 5.13.6 due to incorrect version number threshold
          (RT#74683)

    [0.22] (official fix of all the %^H ickyness)
        - Simplify the >= 5.10 PP variant even more - move the hook from
          DESTROY into DELETE
        - Force explicit callback invocation order on 5.8 PP

    [0.21_02]
        - Replace the %^H tie approach with fieldhashes, fixes all known
          corner cases and caveats on supported perls >= 5.8.1 (FC)
        - Compile away the debugger fixup on perls >= 5.15.5 (FC)

    [0.21_01]
        - More robust handling of the tied %^H in pure perl mode (RT#73402)
        - Limit the debugger workarounds to perls between 5.8.8 and 5.14,
          extend debugger support to all perl versions (FC) (RT#69862)
        - If possible, automatically install (but not load) the debugger
          workaround libraries on perls between 5.8.8 and 5.14 (RT#72368)
        - Add back dropped NAME section (RT#70259)

    [0.21]
        - When using the tie() fallback ensure we do not obliterate a
          foreign tie()
        - Better document how to disable the tie() fallback

    [0.20_01] (the "mst made me do it" release)
        - Only invoke the deleted sub stashing if we run udner a debugger
          (avoid runtime penalty of Sub::Name/Sub::Identify)
        - Spellfixes (RT#54388)
        - When B::Hooks::EndOfScope is not available, switch to a simple
          tie() of %^H. While it can not 100% replace B::H::EOS, it does
          everything n::c needs

    [0.20]
        - Bump Package::Stash dependency to 0.22 to pull in a bugfix in
          Package::Stash::XS 0.19.

    [0.19]
        - Port to the new Package::Stash 0.18 API and depend on it.
        - Don't rely on package::stash's remove_package_symbol implementation
          (doy).

    [0.18]
        - Make sure we continue working on future Package::Stash
          versions (doy).

    [0.17]
        - Make sure the debugger author test is skipped for
          non-authors before the debugger is even loaded.

    [0.16]
        - Release all changes of 0.15 as part of a stable release.
        - Convert from Module::Install to Dist::Zilla.

    [0.15] TRIAL release
        - Use Package::Stash for the stash manipulation bits (doy).

    [0.14] Thu Mar 18 11:15:38 CET 2010
        - Disable auto_install.
        - Turn the error prone debugger test into an author test.

    [0.13] Sun Jan 17 02:40:48 CET 2010
        - Skip failing debugger tests on 5.8.8 and older.

    [0.12] Thu Jan 14 03:22:03 CET 2010
        - Stop relying on stash entries always being upgraded into real GVs
          (Zefram).
        - Work around $DB::sub (Yuval Kogman).
        - Fix restoring of non-code symbols when cleaning (Ben Morrows).

    [0.11] Tue Mar  3 17:34:49 CET 2009

          RT#41850).
        - Added n:c->clean_subroutines($cleanee, @subs).

    [0.10] Fri Feb 20 14:31:36 CET 2009
        - Depend on B::Hooks::EndOfScope 0.07 to avoid segfaults and lost error
          messages when something goes wrong.

    [0.09] Wed Oct 22 17:48:49 CEST 2008
        - Use B::Hooks::EndOfScope instead of %^H + Scope::Guard.

    [0.08] Sun Mar  9 22:01:01 CET 2008
        - Added explicit cleanup behaviour

    [0.07] Sun Mar  9 20:13:33 CET 2008
        - Switched from Filter::EOF to a much saner implementation via
          %^H and Scope::Guard. (mst & autobox)++ for this.

    [0.06] Wed Feb 20 15:09:00 CET 2008
        - Fixed 'uninitialized value in ref-to-glob cast' error
          if unimport was used before.
